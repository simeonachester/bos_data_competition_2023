\section{Introdution}

This paper is based on an analysis of men and women between 15 to 49 years of
age with emphasis on the highest level of school attended for the two groups in
the urban and rural areas. According, to the World Bank\footcite[World
    Bank][]{worldbankruralpop},
approximately 70\% of Guyana's population live in the rural areas. Although a
large proportion of the population live in rural areas, from
experience and observations, education opportunities and social importance
are higher in urban areas than they are in rural areas. One of the objectives
of this analysis was to prove this dissonance empirically.
\section{Data and Descriptive Statistics}
\subsection{Data Collection}

For this study, the dataset \footcite{dataset} was based on a Multiple
Indicator Cluster Survey
(MICS6) conducted in 2018 by the Bureau of Statistics in collaboration with
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) with a sample size of 8700 households
in Guyana
distributed country wide in both urban and rural areas.

The datasets used for this particular study were:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item wm\_Women\ 15\ to\ 49\_Stat\_Day \- Data Set for Surveyed Women in
          Reproductive
          age range 15 \- 17
    \item mn\_Males 15 to 49\_Stat\_Day \- Data Set for Surveyed Men in
          Reproductive
          age Range 15 \- 17
    \item hh\_Household\_Stat\_Day \- Data Set for Surveyed Households
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
All data was processed using the Python programming language \footcite{python}.
The
modules used
in Python were seaborn \footcite{seaborn}, matplotlib \footcite{matplotlib} and
pandas \footcite{pandas}. This document has also been
typset using \LaTeX.

For the men and women data, to get the region and area values, the cluster
number and household number had to be searched for
in the household dataset, with the region and area values extracted from
the matched rows.

The total respondents per region for each region area had to also be calculated
to
get the
averages of each school level in each region by area. However, before doing
this,
all null and not-available values had to be filtered so the total and averages
were not skewed/distorted.

All data and source files used in this analysis have been uploaded to a public
Github repository.
The Jupyter Notebook contained in the Github repository explicitly explains the
steps taken to clean and shape the data and produce the figures
\footcite{githubdata}.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Female highest level of school attended per Area and Region}

For both the urban and rural areas it was observed that the predominant school
level was higher secondary with an average of nearly 50\% of the respondents.
In the rural area this was followed by lower secondary,
primary and then higher with averages of 23\%, 13\% and 12\% respectively.
In the urban area, the higher secondary level was followed by higher, lower
secondary then primary with averages of 21\%, 16\% and 6\% respectively (see
Table \ref{tab:male_female_average} and Figure \ref{fig:male_female_average}).
This shows that in the urban area women are far more likely to attend
institutions of higher learning after finishing their highschool education.
This reason might be attributed to proximity of institutions from living area.
This assumption can be supported by looking at the averages per region, where
regions 3, 4 and 10 is observed to have the greatest portions of women in both
rural and urban areas having attended a higher institution level.

\subsection{Male highest level of school attended per Area and Region}
For both the urban and rural areas it was observed that the predominant school
level was higher secondary with an average of nearly 50\% of the respondents.
In the rural area this was followed by lower secondary, primary then higher
with averages of 26\%, 16\% and 11\% respectively while in the
urban area this was followed by lower secondary, higher then primary with area
averages of 22\%, 18\% and 9\%
respectively (see Table \ref{tab:male_female_average} and Figure
\ref{fig:male_female_average}).
While the positions for the higher and lower secondary levels didn't change
positions
by area, the average level of rural men with primary school levels vs. those in
the urban area did
change positions with third and fourth respectively with a difference of 7\%
more rural men
having primary school as their highest level attended. This is also the reverse
case with the higher school level as
well with a difference of 7\% more in the urban area vs. rural area having a
higher school level attendance.
A look at school level per region shows that regions 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9 have
averages of and above 26\%
of the respondents having lower secondary as their highest school attended (see
Figure \ref{fig:male_attendance}).
These same regions with the exception of region 6 but addition of region 8 have
averages of
about or above the rural average for primary school level of 16\%.
In the urban area, the region that sticks out is region 1 in terms of having a
higher
percentage of its respondents having primary and lower secondary levels of
highest
schooling with both
having 29\% while the higher secondary average is 41\%, a difference of 9\% of
the urban average of 50\% (see Table \ref{tab:male}).

Just like the regions that have the greatest portion of females with higher
school levels,
this is also the case with the males where regions 3, 4, 10 and to some extent
5
and 6 having the
greatest portions of male respondents having a higher level schooling.
The assumption of proximity to higher institutions from living area may also be
applied here.

\subsection{Recommendations}

While more analysis is needed to improve on and test hypotheses, it can be seen
that males have a relatively higher and earlier
school dropout rate than females. However, they both suffer from relatively
high levels
of early dropout especially in the rural areas.

Some recommendations would be

\begin{itemize}
    \item to provide mentoring and apprenticeships in various sectors such as
          sewing,
          carpentry, maisonry etc. While the Government Technical Instutitues
          provide training
          in some of these areas, most students when finished with these
          programmes tend to sit on the certificate and be jobless or have jobs
          that are "lesser" than that which they are either qualified for or
          have the
          certification for (structural unemployment). With both males and
          females, from observations and
          experience, frustration
          steps in and can be crippling and where there's frustration there is
          irrationality.
    \item to improve upon recreational facilities - these facilities are where
          communities reach and are built for better or worse. It often seems
          that the farther
          one goes from the city, the more neglected these facilities are.
          Establishing afterschool programmes in education and sports with
          dedicated
          facilitators at these facilities would help to boost the communities'
          social welfare.
          Given the direct interaction with members in the community, further
          information on the specific
          areas that need attention can be identified and highlighted. Hence,
          improving programmes' effectiveness through efficiency increase.
    \item to improve upon education monitoring, evaluation and programme
          implementation - this improvement is especially needed for rural
          areas that are farthest from the city (see Regions 1 and 8). In these
          areas
          it can often be seen
          children peddling items, working at crossings (see Sherima, Tiperu,
          Iteballi
          etc.) washing vehicles, being porters etc. I believe more needs to be
          done to monitor
          truancy in these areas.
    \item to improve on any programme implementation - this applies to the
          previous recommendations
          and any programmes. In Guyana, programmes are
          often rolled out without seeing it through or lackadaisically
          monitored. For example, government agencies would have a lot of
          planned programmes at the start of
          a fiscal year and only start to implement most of these programmes
          coming on to the end of the year although
          it would have already been budgeted for.
\end{itemize}
%\subsection{Limitations of analysis}
\section{Conclusion}
While the code used to analyse the data was checked, the code and by extension
the data
produced
by
the code has not been peer-reviewed which limits its integrity.
This analysis
also only focuses on a specific parameter i.e. highest level of school
attended which makes the analysis relatively myopic. If further analysis is
done
it would be interesting and wise to look at other parameters in the dataset,
stratify and compare to see their relations (correlation and/or causation).
However, what is evident is that there is a dissonance in school level
attendence between urban and rural areas where a higher school level attendance
favors urban areas as opposed to rural areas. This dissonance is especially
evident for males than females. It would therefore be wise for the Government
of Guyana to implement or improve upon existing programmes to remedy/improve
upon this situation.
